# conv-neural-net-plate-recognition

Neural net to identify the registration number from vehicle number plates.

This employs bounding boxes to identify the plate, then uses a Convolutional Neural Network trained on the MNIST text dataset to identify the letters in the plate.
Data is fed to the Neural network using OpenCV and convolution of the image.
